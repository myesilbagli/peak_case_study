Slide 1 — Comparison Framework + High-Level Result

Title: Power-Up Systems: What I Compared

Mini framework (one row of labels):

Creation (group vs match pattern)

Activation (tap vs swap vs hybrid)

Effect type (row/area/color vs target-seeking)

Meta-system (combos + charge mechanics)

Footprint model (shape on grid)

1-sentence takeaway (bottom):

Same “special item” family, but activation + control rules change pacing and player agency.

(No screenshots needed.)

Slide 2 — Activation Styles (The Core Insight)

Title: Tap-first vs Swap-first vs Hybrid (Friction + Tempo)

Use 3 cards:

Toon Blast — Tap-first

Create: tap groups

Activate: tap

Result: fast, readable, “buttons on board”

Candy Crush — Swap-first

Create: match patterns

Activate: swap

Result: more planning + tradeoffs

Gardenscapes — Hybrid

Swap-based game, but specials can be tapped

Result: lower friction + more control in blocker levels

Visual add-on: a tiny “Friction” bar under each (Low / High / Low).

Slide 3 — “Special Rules” That Change Strategy (2-in-1)

Title: Key Rule Differences That Matter

Split into two columns:

A) Candy Crush: Swap Destination Rule

Combo center = destination tile (where the moved candy lands)

Not the original tile you first selected

✅ Screenshot: Candy Crush combo + arrows (“start” vs “destination (center)”)

B) Candy Crush Fish: Target-Seeking Special

Fish is not footprint-clear (row/area/color)

It’s goal-seeking / semi-random targeting

Speeds objectives but reduces control

✅ Screenshot: Fish hitting blocker/objective (1 screenshot)

Slide 4 — Gardenscapes Deep Dive (Ultimate + Footprint Model)

Title: Gardenscapes: “Ultimate Meter” + Explosion Shape

Split into two stacked sections:

A) Rainbow Blast = Chargeable Ultimate

Meter fills by detonating other power-ups

Multi-power-up chain fills faster

Spawns when full, used intentionally

Doesn’t auto-chain from explosions; activates via swap

✅ Screenshot: your website (charge → spawn → use)

B) Radius Explosion Footprint (Model)

Best modeled as square AOE with clipped corners

Reaches farther in horizontal/vertical than extreme diagonals

✅ Visual: simulator screenshot + simple overlay highlight (or a small drawn grid)

Closing line (bottom):

Gardenscapes adds meta-progression pacing (ultimate) + distinct footprint geometry.
