# Peak case – web version (Q2 & Q4)

## Open locally

Open **`index.html`** in your browser (double-click, or drag into a browser window). No server needed.

The page has two tabs at the top: **Q2 – 7×7 Combo** (interactive board) and **Q4 – A/B Metrics** (charts and parts A–D).

## Share / publish

Use **one link** to the folder (e.g. `https://username.github.io/peak_case_study/`). See **GITHUB_PUBLISH.md** for steps.

Same logic as `q2_bomb_combo.py` (Q2) and `q4_ab_metrics.py` (Q4).
